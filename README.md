Done for fun and to benchmark the [Anubis programming language](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis_%28langage%29) against other programming languages

Result of a benchmark done on a "x64 Ubuntu™ Intel® Q6600® quad-core" machine

======

>Haskell    10000 execution done in 0s and 3ms   (average)
>Anubis     10000 execution done in 0s and 9ms   (average)
>Python     10000 execution done in 0s and 30ms  (average)
>JavaScript 10000 execution done in 0s and 61ms  (average)
>Java       10000 execution done in 0s and 118ms (average)

>Note: Should be taken with a grain of salt, the Java version of the program is surely not the most optimal one.
